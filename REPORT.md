# Connect M Game - Project Report

## Introduction

This project implements a Connect M game where a human plays against a computer opponent. The game is implemented in Python using adversarial search techniques, specifically alpha-beta pruning, to select the optimal move for the computer.

## Agent Model Description

The agent model is designed based on adversarial search principles. The computer agent is modeled as a maximizer aiming to maximize its heuristic score while minimizing the human player's score. The agent uses alpha-beta pruning to efficiently search the game tree, evaluating potential moves to select the optimal action.

## Agent Environment Description

The environment is represented by a two-dimensional grid (board) where players drop disks into columns. The game state includes the board configuration, and actions consist of placing a disk in a valid column. The environment checks for terminal states (win or draw) and provides feedback for each move, allowing the agent to update its strategy.

## Data Structures

- **Board Representation:** The board is represented as a two-dimensional list (list of lists) in Python, where each element is a single character: a space (' ') for an empty cell, 'X' for the human player's disk, and 'O' for the computer's disk.
- **Game State:** The game state includes the board, board size, the number of contiguous disks required to win (`connect_m`), and player turn information.
- **Move Generation:** Valid moves are generated by checking the top row of each column for empty spaces.

## Implementation of Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm

The alpha-beta pruning algorithm is implemented through recursive functions `maxValue` and `minValue`. The algorithm:
- Uses two values, alpha and beta, to track the best score along the current path for the maximizer and minimizer, respectively.
- Prunes branches when the current node's value exceeds the alpha or beta thresholds.
- Recursively explores the game tree until a terminal state or a specified depth cutoff is reached.
- Integrates a heuristic evaluation function to score non-terminal states.

The computer agent, as the maximizer, selects the move that yields the highest score from the alpha-beta search, ensuring efficient decision-making.

## Heuristic Evaluation Function

The heuristic evaluation function assesses the desirability of a board state by:
- Returning a high positive value if the computer wins.
- Returning a high negative value if the human wins.
- Evaluating potential winning segments in rows, columns, and diagonals. Each contiguous segment of length equal to `connect_m` is scored based on the number of disks present.
- The scoring mechanism uses exponential scoring (10 raised to the count of disks) to prioritize segments closer to winning.

## Conclusion

The Connect M game project integrates adversarial search with alpha-beta pruning to provide a challenging computer opponent. The modular design separates game logic from the CLI interface, ensuring maintainability and readability. The project is structured for ease of compilation, execution, and evaluation.
