# Connect M Game

This is a Python implementation of the Connect M game using adversarial search with alpha-beta pruning. In this game, a human player competes against the computer by dropping disks into a grid. The objective is to connect M disks contiguously either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Files

- `connectM_game.py`: Contains the game logic and the implementation of the adversarial search algorithm.
- `main.py`: Contains the command-line interface (CLI) for the game.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `REPORT.md`: Contains the project report outlining the design and implementation details.
- `test.py`: Comprehensive test suite for game logic and CLI functionality. It also includes simulations of computer-vs.-computer games to analyze outcomes.

## How to Run

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command:

```
python3 main.py <N> <M> <H>
```

Where:
- `<N>` is the board size (number of rows and columns, between 3 and 10).
- `<M>` is the number of contiguous disks required to win (greater than 1 and no higher than N).
- `<H>` is a flag indicating who makes the first move: `1` for human and `0` for computer.

### Example

To start a game on a 5x5 board where 4 contiguous disks are needed to win and the human moves first, run:

```
python3 main.py 5 4 1
```

## Configurable Parameters

- **Board Size (N):** Determines the dimensions of the grid. Increasing N increases the playing area.
- **Connect M (M):** Determines how many disks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are required to win. Increasing M makes it harder to achieve a win.
- **First Move Flag (H):** Sets who starts the game. `1` means the human moves first; `0` means the computer starts.
- **Search Depth:** Currently, the search depth for the alpha-beta pruning is hardcoded in `main.py` as 4. Adjusting the depth can trade off between computation time and the quality of the computerâ€™s move:
    - A higher depth may result in a stronger computer opponent but will slow down move selection.
    - A lower depth speeds up the game but may lead to suboptimal moves.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite in `test.py` that covers:
- **Game Logic Tests:** Validates move validation, win/draw detection, heuristic evaluation, and alpha-beta search.
- **CLI Tests:** Simulates command-line invocations to ensure proper error handling for invalid inputs.
- **Computer-vs.-Computer Simulations:** Runs multiple simulated games where the computer plays against itself. This helps analyze whether the game always ends in a draw, or if a win can be forced under certain circumstances.

To run the tests, execute:

```
python3 test.py
```

Enjoy the game!
